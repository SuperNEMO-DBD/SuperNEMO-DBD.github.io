SuperNEMO is delighted to share that Tomáš successfully defended his thesis at the Czech Technical University in Prague, passed his final master’s examination, and was awarded his diploma cum laude!

The name of his thesis is "Algorithm for particle track reconstruction in SuperNEMO detector". This algoritm combines recursive clustering, Legendre transform techniques, and a maximum likelihood procedure to achieve precise and robust trajectory reconstruction, even in complex event topologies. Dedicated methods resolve ambiguities and account for scattering, and the algorithm is implemented as a full data processing module.
