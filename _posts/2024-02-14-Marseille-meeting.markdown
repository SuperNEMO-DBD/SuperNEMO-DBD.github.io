The SuperNEMO collaboration met for a mid winter meeting in Marseilleâ€™s Palais du Pharo. The meeting was a fruitful discussion on the recent milestones of our detector, such as the ongoing shielding installation, electronics problem solving and discussion of the data taken over the summer of 2023. Many great moments and sardines were enjoyed at this meeting. We also held a video competition in which our students had to make a short 2 minute video describing different aspects of the SuperNEMO experiment. The students did a fantastic job and the resulting videos are available to view under the [Experiment](https://supernemo.org/about.html) section of the website. Congratulations to Kaela from the University of Edinburgh for her winning video on the Se82 source foils!
