With data taking soon to start, the collaboration opted for an online catch up to get up to speed with all of the latest progress. Iron shielding completion, data processing updates, radon commissioning and the helium recycling system updates were eagerly discussed. The collaboration was feeling festive and excited for 2025 - the year SuperNEMO will be fully up and running!
